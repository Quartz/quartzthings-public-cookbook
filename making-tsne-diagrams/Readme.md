# How to make a tSNE network graphic
This tutorial uses a `node.js` script to generate our model. The output data is then rendered in an Observable notebook.

1. First `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Open `model.js` in this folder and make sure you understand what's going on under the hood.
3. Run `node model.js`
4. Take your output `JSON` file, upload it to gist.github.com and link to it in this [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@sadbumblebee/tsne-graphs-done-quik).

_More information on how the module works is [here](https://github.com/karpathy/tsnejs)._
